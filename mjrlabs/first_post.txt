Welcome to MJR Labs, my personal blog/ Lab notebook

July 16, 2017

I am currently in the process of migrating my blog from a Wordpress site on GoDaddy, to a Django application hosted on Heroku. I have been a fan of Wordpress for a long time, but as a developer I need a platform that provides the flexibility and scalability of a full MVC framework.

For a long time now, I've wanted to improve my skills as a writer. It's an important means of communication on the Internet, and the ability to write clearly and concisely will go a long way. Once I have a decent page for writing on my backend, I will be sharing random thoughts and opinions here. It feels important to me to use a custom built platform, as opposed to a large social media site like Facebook or Twitter. I'm an idealistic believer in the decentralized internet, and this is an example of me being the change I want to see in the world

On top of being a writing platform, my plan is to treat this site as a technical sandbox. I like learning about different technologies and frameworks, and I need a space where I can quickly iterate on new projects.
